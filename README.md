  - Green works great, though I'm struggling to find proper HSV settings for red.
    A red screen works well (check for reflections that can overwhelm the screen), 
    but red objects don't work well.  This may have something to do with white-balance
    and the Mac iSight camera, but I don't know enough about this to fix it.
    Any help on this is greatly appreciated.
